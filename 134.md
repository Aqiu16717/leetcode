# 134. Gas Station

```
-   -   -   -   -   -   -   -
        i           j
```
* **conclusion**: *Assume that `i` can reach `j` at the farthest. We should consider `j+1` next time.*

Why do the stations between `i` and `j` no longer need to be considered? 

Let's illustrate this using proof by contradiction.

Assume that `i+1` meets the requirements and it can complete a circle.  
At first wo move from `i` to `i+1`, and then from `i+1` to `j+1`
So we can reach `j+1` from `i`.  
But `i` only can reach `j`.
There's contradiction and the proof is complete.
